# Matrix Operations in C

A menu-driven C program that performs common matrix operations using 2D arrays and modular functions.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my **CodeAlpha C Programming Internship**.

The program allows users to perform:

* Matrix Addition
* Matrix Multiplication
* Matrix Transpose

It also includes input validation and a menu-driven interface for easy interaction.

## ✨ Features

### 1. Matrix Addition

Adds two matrices of the same dimensions.

### 2. Matrix Multiplication

Multiplies two matrices when the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.

### 3. Matrix Transpose

Converts rows into columns and columns into rows.

### 4. Input Validation

The program validates matrix dimensions and limits matrices to a maximum size of **10 × 10**.

### 5. Menu-Driven Interface

Users can select operations from a simple interactive menu.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* C Programming
* 2D Arrays
* Functions
* Loops
* Conditional Statements
* Input Validation
